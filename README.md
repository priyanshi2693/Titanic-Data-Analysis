🚢 Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis
📌 Overview
This project is part of my internship at SkillCraft Technologies, where I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.

🔍 Objectives
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Perform EDA to uncover insights into passenger survival rates, demographics, ticket classes, and more.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Pandas (Data Cleaning)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Includes:
✅ Survival Rate Analysis based on age, gender, and class.
✅ Feature Correlation to identify key factors affecting survival.
✅ Distribution & Trends using histograms, bar charts, and box plots.
 
📌 Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.
